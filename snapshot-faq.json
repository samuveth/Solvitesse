      "question": "What is Snapshot?",
      "answer": "Snapshot is an off-chain voting platform that allows DAOs, DeFi protocols, or NFT communities to vote easily and without gas fees. The tool allows high customization of the voting process to cater to the diverse needs of the users and organizations. Customization includes different aspects like calculation of the users' voting power, selection of the voting mechanism, proposal and vote validation, and many more."
    },
    {
      "id": "84",
      "question": "What does 'snapshot' mean?",
      "answer": "In cryptocurrency, a snapshot is a record of the state of the blockchain at a particular block height. It means that you can for example track the holdings of a specific wallet back to a specific point in time. Snapshot, the voting platform, is using snapshots to validate if voters met the voting criteria at the moment of proposal creation. If a voter acquired required tokens after the proposal has been created, these newly acquired tokens would not be used for calculation of their voting power."
    },
    {
      "id": "85",
      "question": "Is Snapshot free to use?",
      "answer": "Yes. To create a space, you have to own an ENS domain and perform one transaction on-chain. Voting or proposing is completely free."
    },
    {
      "id": "86",
      "question": "Do I need to create a user account?",
      "answer": "No. Snapshot uses the universal web3 login - you need to have a wallet account like Metamask or Coinbase to connect to Snapshot."
    },
    {
      "id": "87",
      "question": "What is a space?",
      "answer": "You can think of a space as an organization's account on Snapshot which can be viewed by anyone visiting the platform. It serves as a hub for all proposals related to the organization and a source of information for the users. It’s also where users will vote on proposals in their community."
    },
    {
      "id": "88",
      "question": "What is a proposal?",
      "answer": "Proposals are key elements of the voting system. It presents a change suggestion related to a specific organization and enables eligible users to cast their vote."
    },
    {
      "id": "89",
      "question": "How can I vote?",
      "answer": "You need to connect to Snapshot with your wallet and fulfil the requirements defined by the voting strategies used by a specific space. For example, you might be required to hold a specific amount of the organization’s token. You can see the voting strategies directly on a proposal’s page in the Information section. If you are eligible to vote, you can cast your vote directly from the proposal’s page. Once you select the choice(s) and confirm your vote, a new window will pop up and open your wallet extension in the browser. You will be then asked to sign a message which doesn’t create any gas fees (voting is free of charge) or affect your holdings. Signing the message is the last step of casting a vote. That’s it!"
    },
    {
      "id": "90",
      "question": "Can I vote on any proposal?",
      "answer": "No. Your eligibility to vote depends on the voting strategies defined by the space and usually requires holding the organization’s token. Some spaces allow anyone to vote, however this is a rare case. You can read more about the voting strategies in our documentation: what-is-a-strategy.md"
    },
    {
      "id": "91",
      "question": "Can I create a proposal?",
      "answer": "It depends on the space settings. Spaces can set up a validation strategy which defines who is eligible to create a proposal, for example you need to hold at least 1ETH in your wallet in order to do so. Moreover, spaces can specify a list of users who can create proposals by listing their wallet addresses in the space settings. You can read more about space settings and proposal validation."
    },
    {
      "id": "92",
      "question": "Is voting on Snapshot safe?",
      "answer": "Yes. The message you sign in your wallet to cast the vote doesn’t affect your holdings or web3 identity. There are some spaces which are flagged with a warning badge if we suspect them to be fake but you don’t need to worry if you have cast a vote on their proposal. There is no risk to your funds associated with signing a Snapshot vote. You can read more about the badges in our documentation: badges-and-warnings.md"
    },
    {
      "id": "93",
      "question": "I can’t vote, what should I do?",
      "answer": "There might be multiple reasons for that. Most usually you didn’t have the required tokens in you wallet at the time of proposal creation. Have a look at this discussion to explore other potential reasons."
    },

If it doesn’t answer your question or you would like to get in touch with regard to another topic, you can reach us in our Discord server and send a message in appropriate channel (i.e. #general) or create a new thread on the #helpdesk forum."
    },
    {

      "question": "I have an issue, where should I report it?",
      "answer": "Before you report it make sure to browse through this FAQ, our documentation or the Discord server. There is a high chance that the issue has already been discussed before. If not, create a new thread on the helpdesk forum with the following details:\n\n* Clear title describing your issue\n* Tags which are related to the problem\n* Detailed description of the issue: what action were you trying to perform (i.e. casting a vote), what error did you get\n* Screenshots - provide the screenshots of the error you are getting\n* URLs - applicable urls, i.e. proposal or space url"

    },
    {
      "id": "98",
      "question": "I delegated my voting power but would like to take it back. How can I do it?",
      "answer": "You can remove your delegations by going to https://demo.snapshot.org/#/delegate and clicking the ❌ for the delegations you wish to remove. Moreover, if you want to override your delegate’s vote on a proposal using the delegation strategy you can simply cast your own vote and it will override the delegate’s vote. If the delegation happened on-chain, then head to the delegation portal of the project you’re looking for and redelegate there."

      "id": "100",
      "question": "I get “Your voting power could not be calculated due to misconfigured strategy or unresponsive RPC node”. What should I do?",
      "answer": "This issue is related to either space settings or the failure of the external infrastructure that Snapshot relies on. We recommend to wait 15 minutes before trying again. If the error persists, please post a message in the Misconfigured node thread on helpdesk forum on Discord with the following details:\n\n* URL of the proposal you were trying to vote on\n* The error message you received (in this case: “Your voting power could not be calculated due to misconfigured strategy or unresponsive RPC node”)\n* Did you wait for 15 minutes before trying to cast the vote again"

      "question": "There is a proposal that's open until tomorrow and I have a new token that was minted today, after the proposal’s creation. Can that token be used to vote?",
      "answer": "No. Snapshot calculates the voting power on the basis of proposal creation time. If the token has not been stored in the wallet before the proposal was created it will not be taken into account."

    {
      "id": "108",
      "question": "Can I change the name of my space?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can do it in the space settings. Do not confuse it with changing the ID or the ENS domain for your space. To do that, you need to migrate the space. You can read more about changing the ENS domain in our documentation: delete-a-space.md"

      "id": "111",
      "question": "I made a mistake with my space settings and I want to cancel existing votes. How can I do it?",
      "answer": "You cannot invalidate existing votes. However you can delete the proposal. If you are an admin of the space or proposal’s creator you can delete the current proposal by clicking Delete on the proposal’s page. Then change the space settings and make sure to persist the changes. Once the settings have been updated you can recreate the proposal from scratch."

    },
    {
      "id": "115",
      "question": "Why is my voting power equal to 0?",
      "answer": "There might be multiple reasons for that. Most usually your voting power is equal to 0 as you didn’t have the required tokens in your wallet at the time of proposal creation. Have a look at this discussion to explore other potential reasons."

    {
      "id": "116",
      "question": "Why is my voting power reduced? I’m a delegate.",
